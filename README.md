## CDC-Diabetic-Health-Indicators
A machine learning project on the BRFSS2015 CDC dataset. In this dataset, I have implemented classification model algorithms to predict outcomes of responders as diabetic or non-diabetic/prediabetic.

As the first step, I have imported all the necessary libraries, loaded the dataset, and executed preliminary codes to understand all the properties of the dataset such as shape, statistics summary, feature details, etc.
